      VeriTrust is trust infrastructure for AI agents and MCP servers.
      It uses decentralized identifiers (DIDs), verifiable credentials (VCs),
      and queryable registries with revocation—so platforms can verify who runs a tool,
      what it can do, and whether it is still allowed.
    problem_statement:
      - "MCP standardizes how agents call tools, but not who to trust."
      - "Enterprises need identity, attestations, policy, and revocation."
      - "Without governance, tool access becomes a supply-chain risk."
    solution_statement:
      - "DID-based identity for servers, agents, and issuers."
      - "VC attestations for ownership, environment, audit/compliance status."
      - "Trust registries for discovery + policy enforcement."
      - "Revocation for fast containment when compromised."

  key_messages:
    pillar_1:
      title: "Identity that can be verified"
      points:
        - "Every server/issuer can be anchored to a DID."
        - "Keys and controllers are verifiable, not implied."
    pillar_2:
      title: "Attestations you can check"
      points:
        - "Use VCs for ownership, environment, audit status."
        - "Support portable verification across ecosystems."
    pillar_3:
      title: "Governance you can enforce"
      points:
        - "Registries + policy define what is allowed."
        - "Revocation enables containment and lifecycle control."

  proof_points:
    technical:
      - "W3C DID and VC alignment (standards-first)."
      - "Queryable registries with lookup/search."
      - "Revocation status as a first-class concept."
    operational:
      - "Production deployment paths exist (ANS, registry, A2A)."

  calls_to_action:
    developer:
      - "Resolve an agent name with ANS"
      - "List MCP servers from the registry"
      - "Verify a VC chain"
    enterprise:
      - "Define allowed issuers and policies"
      - "Integrate verification in your tool gateway"
      - "Set up revocation workflows"

  boilerplate_descriptions:
    short: "Verifiable identity and trust infrastructure for AI agents and MCP servers."
    medium: >
      VeriTrust provides DID-based identity, VC-based attestations, and policy-enforced registries
      so AI platforms can verify tools and agents before use.
    long: >
      VeriTrust is trust infrastructure for the agentic ecosystem: decentralized identifiers (DIDs),
      verifiable credentials (VCs), and registries with governance and revocation. It supports agent naming (ANS),
      MCP trust registries, and delegation controls for enterprise-safe deployments.
