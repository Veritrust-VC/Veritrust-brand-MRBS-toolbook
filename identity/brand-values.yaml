  mission: >
    Provide verifiable identity, credentials, and governance infrastructure for AI agents,
    MCP servers, and digital entities—so trust can be checked, not assumed.
  vision: >
    A practical, interoperable trust layer for the agentic internet: identities anchored in
    cryptography, governed by policy, and verifiable across ecosystems.
  principles:

    - "Safety over speed: ship secure defaults."
